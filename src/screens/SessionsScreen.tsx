And since then a bunch of new libraries like Koin or Kodein appeared. Developers are even writing articles how to do DI without any framework.\r\nSome argue that those don’t even offer real dependency injection. Let’s look at that argument and compare the approaches.\r\nSo, is there something wrong with Dagger & co. in Kotlin? Are they obsolete? What are the alternatives? Let’s dive in.",

        description:
          "In Android application development, we live in an asynchronous world, operations such as API calls, DB queries and heavy background computation are prevalent in most applications.\r\nThe UI thread, which is responsible for UI updates and receiving user input events cannot be used to perform these operations.\r\n\r\nThe android framework has bundled with it different options for performing such long running operation in a background thread, some of which include AsyncTask, IntentService and plain old java Thread. Each of these above listed approaches come with their own drawbacks and as a result, third party approaches have also been tried. RxJava, which is the most popular of these libraries, while it does a good job in scheduling operations in the background, switching threads and composing operations, it comes with a major drawback which is its steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Kotlin and its increase popularity in Android application development, provides us with yet another option for running background operations with coroutines.  In this talk, we will be learning about what coroutines are, why coroutines and how to use them in android applications.\r\n",

          "Using Kotlin for Android development has grown in popularity over the last year. Even to those who are not currently using it, the value proposition of the language immediately resonates. There already are a lot of introductory talks to the language and its extensions for use on Android. This talk will cover advancing the usage and design patterns of the language for Android development to solve larger problems. While the content is targeted at mobile development, there will be value for all Java developers interested in Kotlin.\r\nPrior knowledge or use of Kotlin is not required to attend this talk. Some concepts of the language will be used without introduction but they are intuitive and/or quickly learned. Even if you don’t fully understand every language concept on which each example is built, the resulting functionality will be clear.\r\n\r\nSections\r\n- Signs on Kotlin Street(What is Kotlin all about?)\r\n- Why we need Kotlin\r\n- Examples(using code snippets)\r\n- Demo of apps running on kotlin\r\n-The future of Kotlin(in mobile, web and machine learning)\r\n-Short Quiz\r\n-Q/A\r\n",
